The script for fitting Markarian 421 data from the "Investigation of the correlation patterns and the Compton dominance variability of Mrk 421 in 2017" paper, https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/11/aa41004-21/aa41004-21.html.

To run the script you only need to set the MJD variable at the beginning of the script to select the appropriate day. 

The SED data will be downloaded automatically, 
and the parameters for fitting will be taken from the Table5 file, which is a copy of data from https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/11/aa41004-21/T5.html
